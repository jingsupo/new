# {{ page.title }}

This is a tentative homepage for information on Git development. If you
stumbled into this by mistake, you may want:

  - <http://git-scm.com>, which has information on running
    git and links to download the latest version

  - <http://git.wiki.kernel.org>, the wiki that has historically
    contained developer information

These pages are intended to collect information useful to Git
developers, including collaborative editing of documents (i.e., it is an
alternative to us having a wiki, but one that is edited entirely via git
pushes).

Note that this page is an experiment and a work in progress. It may go
away at any time if it turns out not to be useful.
