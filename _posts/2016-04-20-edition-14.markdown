## Git Rev News: Edition 14 (April 20th, 2016)

Welcome to the 14th edition of [Git Rev News](https://git.github.io/rev_news/rev_news/),
a digest of all things Git. For our goals, the archives, the way we work, and how to contribute or to
subscribe, see [the Git Rev News page](https://git.github.io/rev_news/rev_news/) on [git.github.io](https://git.github.io).

This edition covers what happened during the month of March 2016 and
also what happened at the Git Contributor Summit on April 4 2016 and
at the Git Merge conference on April 5 2016.

## Discussions

### General

* Discussions at the Git Contributor Summit, part 1, about big repos and big files

The Git Contributor Summit happened on April 4th at the panoramic
rooftop bar of
[the citizenM hotel in New York City, USA](https://www.citizenm.com/destinations/new-york/new-york-times-square).
The whole bar had been reserved by GitHub for the Summit from 10am to
4pm.

Around 20 developers attended. Drinks were provided, and food was
served during the lunch break. Afterwards GitHub also invited
attendants to a dinner at a nearby Italian restaurant.

As usual it was an unconference. Attendants interested in discussing a
topic wrote it on a board, where everyone could vote for it.

The topics that attracted most votes were about performance on big
repositories.

First it was said that it is unfortunate that the performance of many
git commands, like for example `git log`, depends linearly on the
number of refs in the repository.

One possible solution to this problem would be to use some kind of
binary search algorithm to look up refs. Unfortunately that is not easy, as
replaced refs in 'refs/replace/' must all be read, and additionally the current implementation
of the backend requires some stat(2) calls to check if there are any loose refs.

This problem should at least partially be solved with the current work
going on to implement additional ref backends, especially a
[lmdb](http://symas.com/mdb/) based one.

(This work on an lmdb based ref backend has been reported on in
[Git Rev News edition 12](https://git.github.io/rev_news/2016/02/10/edition-12/) and
[Git Rev News edition 7](https://git.github.io/rev_news/2015/09/09/edition-7/).)

From there the discussion switched to the case sensitiveness of ref
names, and the different problems created by having ref names that
should also be proper filenames: slow filesystems like NTFS, unicode
normalizing filesystems like HFS+, file/directory collisions, reflog
deletion, and more.

It was also mentioned that the tree object lookup could be sped up,
but that it would require a more efficient packfile format.

The current effort to implement an `index-helper` daemon to speed up
index reading was also described.

Then some time was spent discussing large objects. Some objects
are able to be stored locally, while others are not. This means that
doing something similar to rsync, where it manages chunks of files,
might not always be possible.

Git LFS is now offered by at least GitHub and Microsoft, however
there are still a number of problems with it from a user
perspective. For example, it is not shipped with Git, and it is not always
easy to know which files should go into it.

It also looks like the filters used by Git LFS to trigger big
file downloads are executed sequentially, which is not good for
performance.

This made people mention potential problems with parallelizing
`git checkout`.

One possibility to improve on Git LFS would be to create another kind
of backend for git objects that would be optimized for large files and
would sit alongside loose objects and packfiles.

The subject next switched to possible ways of speeding up `git status`. The
`index-helper` daemon effort was described again, as it can use
[the watchman library](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) to
efficiently monitor the working tree for changes. Unfortunately, the watchman service
must be run manually for now, and running daemons on Windows
might require some admin rights.

The recently merged effort on improving the untracked cache in the
index was also mentionned.

* [Linux Kernel Development - Going Faster Than You Think](https://github.com/gregkh/kernel-development)

The [Git Merge conference](http://git-merge.com/) happened this year
on April 5th at [New World Stages](http://newworldstages.com/) in New
York City, USA.

The first presentation of [the packed schedule](http://git-merge.com/#schedule)
was given by [Greg Kroah-Hartman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Kroah-Hartman)
and was about how the Linux Kernel developers are using Git.

(The slides are available in
[Greg's Github repo for this presentation](https://github.com/gregkh/kernel-development)
either in
[pdf format](https://github.com/gregkh/kernel-development/blob/master/kernel-git.pdf) or in
[odp format](https://github.com/gregkh/kernel-development/blob/master/kernel-git.odp).)

Greg works at the [Linux Foundation](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/).
He is the maintainer of the Kernel '-stable' branches and of many
subsystems like USB.

He said that the Linux Kernel is made of more than 21 million lines of
code, in more than 53 000 files. Everything is in the tree, and drivers account
for around one third of the size. Nearly 4000 developers and around 400 companies
are involved.

This makes the Linux Kernel the largest software project ever.

Around 10 000 lines are added, 5300 lines are removed, and 1800 lines
are modified, everyday!

That's on average 7.8 changes per hour accross the whole tree with 5%
in the core, 10% in the networking subsystem, and 55% in the drivers.

This goes against any previously thought methodology for stable
software development, and things are only getting faster and faster.

Things are going so fast that it costs money to keep your code outside
the kernel.

There is a new release every 2.5 months, so if your code is rejected
you have to wait 2 months before it can be in the next release. This
is very predictable.

The release cycle is made of a two week long "merge window" and then
some "rc" releases - one per week. During the "merge window", code is
merged from subsystem maintainers. The "rc" releases, "rc-1", "rc-2",
... , "rc-7" are bug fixes only. Once all major bugs and regressions
are fixed a release is made and the cycle starts over with a new merge
window.

For "stable" kernels that Greg maintains, they are forked from Linux
releases. Commits have to go in Linus' tree first before Greg will
accept them. It should be the same identical patch as what is in
Linus' tree, and it should be "bug fixes only" or new device ids. The
Linux distributions usually run from "stable" kernels.

The "longterm" kernels are maintained for 2 years. Current "longterm"
kernels are 3.14, 4.1 and 4.4.

This works well for many companies, but sometimes maintaining a kernel
for 2 years is not enough. Japan is converting all its infrastructure
to Linux, and people want some kernels maintained for 20 years.

The patches sent for inclusion into the Kernel should be standalone.
None of them should break the build. Each patch set should be obvious,
broken down into the smallest reasonable patches, and every change
should be correct. One half to one third of submitted patches get accepted. 

This puts work on the developer's shoulders. But that's on purpose,
because there are many more developers than maintainers. There are
1000 maintainers, but only around 700 are active.

To reach the maintainers, patches should be sent to the relevant
mailing list, like the usb mailing list or the scsi mailing list.
Andrew Morton reads the lkml mailing list.

The email format should be plain text. It's old school but works very,
very well. The Developer's Certificate of Origin (DCO) is used to
ensure that people have the right to submit a patch. This is the same
process that Git uses.

After a patch has been reviewed by a file or driver maintainer, the
maintainer will add his own "Signed-off-by" and will send it to a
subsystem maintainer.

There are around 200 subsystem maintainers. They have their own trees
on git.kernel.org.

Every night the "linux-next" is created from these 200 trees and is
built and boot tested on different platforms.

Andrew Morton uses quilt to maintain his "-mm" kernels made from
patches picked by himself from the lkml mailing list or elsewhere.

A couple of years ago, Kernel developers realized that nobody actually
tested the kernel.

To address this, there is now a "0 day bot" that run tests and static analysis tools,
like coccinelle or sparse, automatically on all the kernel trees. It
tests every comment, and has a script that writes patches for common
problems. The bot also picks patches from the mailing lists to test.

When a new merge window opens, the subsystem maintainers and Andrew
Morton send what they think is ready to Linus, so he can merge it. The
rule is that what is sent to Linus should have already been in
linux-next. 10 000 to 11 000 patches are usually merged in the 2 week
long merge window.

Following Greg's talk, Stefan Beller asked on the mailing list if Greg
could put the Git developers in touch with the 0 day bot developers
and [a discussion started](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/291242/)
about how the 0 day bot could be used.

## Developer Spotlight: Johannes Sixt

* Who are you, and what do you do?

I am a seasoned software engineer. Professionally, I work on Windows
most of the time and develop software in C++. At home, I am operating
only Linux and contribute to various Open Source projects. Most
prominently, KDbg (http://www.kdbg.org/), a GUI around the debugger
GDB, is my child.

* What would you name your most important contribution to Git?

I was the first one to present a working and usable Git on Windows. By
this I mean git.exe, the program, not the package Git for Windows
(which is another great achievement, but it is not mine). Of course,
it was possible to operate Git on Windows using Cygwin before my
contribution. But the Cygwin runtime is such a thick layer between the
POSIX and Windows APIs that file operations are very, very slow. My
goal was to make git.exe a native Windows program and considerably
faster. And that is it today when we talk about "Git for Windows".

* What are you doing on the Git project these days, and why?

In our software shop, we use Git a lot. That is sufficient motivation
to keep an eye on its development. These days I'm doing mostly
janitory work to keep Git working on Windows.

* If you could get a team of expert developers to work full time on
  something in Git for a full year, what would it be?

Port Git to C++. When done right, there would not be any worries about
memory leaks, chatty error messages, extra function parameters to
choose whether a library function should return or die on error. Code
could be written much shorter. Librarification would be achieved in a
natural way. Subsequently, turning shell scripts into built-in
commands would become much easier. For example, you wouldn't even have
to ask "does the git-apply machinery clean up after itself
sufficiently so that we can call it multiple times from one program?"
(Yes, it would do so automatically.)

* If you could remove something from Git without worrying about
  backwards compatibility, what would it be?

I have learned to live with Git's quirks. Therefore, it's difficult to
find something that is really an obstacle for me. But with an eye on
newcomers, I think I would pick the term "cache" and its variants as a
candidate for removal.

(Oh, it looks like I'm in good company of Matthieu Moy, who thinks likewise.)

* What is your favourite Git-related tool/library, outside of Git itself?

I think I work exclusively with git-core tools (if you count in
git-gui and gitk). The closest that comes to mind that are both
"related" and "favourite" are Meld and Winmerge when driven by
git-difftool and git-mergetool.
