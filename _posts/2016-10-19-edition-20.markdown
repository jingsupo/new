* [Changing the default for "core.abbrev"?](http://public-inbox.org/git/CA+55aFy0_pwtFOYS1Tmnxipw9ZkRNCQHmoYyegO00pjMiZQfbg@mail.gmail.com/) (*written by Jakub Narębski*)

Linus Torvalds asked for increasing the default value for number of
characters in SHA-1 abbreviations.  The `default_abbrev = 7` was
reasonable in the early days of Git, but a project of the size of the
Linux kernel needs `git config --global core.abbrev 12`. While Git
will extend the seven hex digits until the object name is unique,
that only reflects the *current* situation in the repository. It gets
annoying when a commit message has a short git ID that is no longer
unique a few months later when one needs to go back and try to figure
out what went wrong in that commit.

Jeff King, alias Peff, answered the *"it gets annoying"* part in the
[[PATCH 0/10] helping people resolve ambiguous sha1s](https://public-inbox.org/git/20160926115720.p2yb22lcq37gboon@sigill.intra.peff.net/)
patch series (merged in [66c22ba6](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/git/git.git/commit/?id=66c22ba6fbe0724ecce3d82611ff0ec5c2b0255f)).
This patch series taught Git to help in the situation where only
ambiguous shortened identifier is available, by listing the SHA-1s
of the objects it found, along with a few bits of information that
may help the user decide which one they meant.

>       $ git rev-parse b2e1
>       error: short SHA1 b2e1 is ambiguous
>       hint: The candidates are:
>       hint:   b2e1196 tag v2.8.0-rc1
>       hint:   b2e11d1 tree
>       hint:   b2e1632 commit 2007-11-14 - Merge branch 'bs/maint-commit-options'
>       hint:   b2e1759 blob
>       hint:   b2e18954 blob
>       hint:   b2e1895c blob

The problem of Git providing SHA-1 abbreviation which would soon be
invalid was solved in different way than proposed by Linus.  Instead
of increasing the default abbrev length for all projects, making abbrevs
longer and more unwieldy also for small projects that don't need it,
Peff [proposed](https://public-inbox.org/git/20160929092204.eod2cvtrqg5whu6h@sigill.intra.peff.net/)
to make default abbrev length be dynamically based on the number of objects
in the repository.  Linus sent [rough implementation](https://public-inbox.org/git/CA+55aFwbCNiF0nDppZ5SuRcZwc9kNvKYzgyd_bR8Ut8XRW_p4Q@mail.gmail.com/)
of this idea, which after a few iterations (and cleanups of related code)
got merged into 'next' as [bb188d00f7](https://github.com/git/git/commit/bb188d00f7).

* [Prepare the sequencer for the upcoming rebase -i patches](http://public-inbox.org/git/cover.1472457609.git.johannes.schindelin@gmx.de/)

Johannes Schindelin, alias Dscho, is the maintainer of Git for
Windows. He is working for Microsoft and, on top of his maintainer
role, he has been working whenever time allowed since February this
year to speed up interactive rebase (`git rebase -i`).

Since when it was created in 2005, the `git rebase` command has been
implemented using shell scripts that are calling other git commands.

The interactive rebase that Dscho implemented in 2007 calls different
commands than the regular, non interactive, rebase. The regular rebase
uses `git format-patch` to create a patch series from some commits,
and then `git am` to apply this patch series on top of a different
commit, while the interactive rebase calls `git cherry-pick`
repeatedly for the same purpose.

Neither of these approaches has been very efficient though, and the
main reason behind that is that repeatedly calling a git command has a
significant overhead. Even the regular `git rebase` would do that as
`git am` had been implemented by launching `git apply` on each of the
patches.

The overhead is especially big on Windows where creating a new process
is quite slow, but even on other OSes it requires setting up
everything from scratch, then reading the index from disk, and then,
after performing some changes, writing the index back to the disk.

In case of the regular rebase,
[a patch series has been merged recently](https://github.com/git/git/commit/81358dc238372793b1590efa149cc1581d1fbd98)
to the 'master' branch that makes `git am` call `git apply`'s internal
functions without spawning the latter as a separate process. So the
regular rebase will be significantly faster especially on Windows and
for big repositories in the next Git feature release.

Dscho's work achieves the same kind of results for the interactive
rebase. The work, which has been distilled to the mailing list has a
series of patch series, greatly improves and then uses a mechanism
called the sequencer.

The sequencer had been from it's beginning
[in 2008 as a GSoC (Google Summer of Code) project](https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/SoC2008Ideas#Implement_git-sequencer)
envisioned as a low-level patch-application engine written in C that
would "take the 'todo' file format used by git-rebase -i and extend it
to also support applying patches split out of mbox files", so that
"frontends like git-am, git-rebase, etc. can then setup the 'todo'
script and pass it to git-sequencer, which does the actual patch
application, editing, etc."

Of course it was a too much ambitious project for a GSoC project, so
the work that Stephan Beyer, the GSoC student at that time, did to
implement it was not merged. A lot of great related work by Stephan
had been merged though, and the sequencer idea as well as Stephan's
code were still considered valuable, so that in 2011
[another GSoC project was attempted](https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/SoC2011Ideas#git_cherry-pick_--continue.2F--abort.2F--skip_and_git_sequencer)
to further the idea and Stephan's code. This time the goal was to
first use the sequencer to improve cherry-picking, and reverting, many
commits, and Ramkumar Ramachandra, alias Ram, succeeded. The sequencer
code got merged and it was now possible to "continue", "abort" or
"skip" when cherry-picking or reverting many commits.

Despite this success, Dscho has had to improve a lot of things to make
it possible to reuse the sequencer in the interactive rebase. For
example he had to create a git-rebase--helper in C that ported a lot
of the functionality from the git-rebase--interactive.sh shell
script.

As Dscho explains [in an answer to a question by Jakub Narębski](http://public-inbox.org/git/alpine.DEB.2.20.1609021432070.129229@virtualbox/),
who asked about the status of the patch series, 10 of his patch series
had already been accepted, 5 were in flight and 1 had not yet been
submitted at the beginning of September.

These patch series, will speed up the interactive rebase, but are not
enough to fully replace the rebase implementation in shell by one in
C. According to Dscho such a result is "*far, far, far* in the future":

> ...my hope is that the rebase--helper work is only an initial step,
> opening the door for other contributors to tackle independent parts
> of making git-rebase a builtin

Though the patch series have been reviewed by a large number of
experienced Git developers like Junio Hamano, Johannes Sixt, Torsten
Bögershausen, Jeff King, Jakub Narębski, Dennis Kaarsemaker, Eric
Sunshine, Kevin Daudt and Stefan Beller, they are not fully merged
into Git yet. But Dscho already "integrated the whole shebang into Git
for Windows 2.10.0 and 2.10.1" that were released recently, and "it
has been running without complaints (and some quite positive
feedback)".

About the performance improvements, Dscho wrote:

> The end game of this patch series is a git-rebase--helper that makes
> rebase -i 5x faster on Windows (according to t/perf/p3404). Travis says
> that even MacOS X and Linux benefit (4x and 3x, respectively).

Such performance improvements as well as the code consolidations
around the sequencer are of course very nice. It is interesting and
satisfying to see that they are the result of building on top of
previous work over the years by GSoC students, mentors and reviewers.

* [What’s new in Git for Windows 2.10?](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudioalm/2016/09/03/whats-new-in-git-for-windows-2-10/) (*written by Jakub Narębski*)

Dscho wrote about making _interactive rebase_ much faster in a recent
[blog post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudioalm/2016/09/03/whats-new-in-git-for-windows-2-10/)
(linked to in previous Git Rev News), repeating and extending information
from his answer mentioned in the above article. Among others, he wrote
how can he be sure that the code is ready:

And further:

One can find which regressions were there in the [followup on git mailing list](http://public-inbox.org/git/alpine.DEB.2.20.1609111010440.129229@virtualbox/).
It is interesting to find the use of the [Scientist library](https://github.com/github/scientist)
for ensuring the quality of Git code refactoring.

* [[PATCH/RFC] git log --oneline alternative with dates, times and initials](https://public-inbox.org/git/git-log-times@mackyle-at-gmail-com/) (*written by Jakub Narębski*)

Kyle J. McKay had have been wanting a compact one line output format that
included dates, times and initials, and is compatible with `--graph`.

```
  === 2015-09-17 ===

                     ..........
* ecad27cf 10:32 jch (tag: v2.3.9) Git 2.3.9
```

![see above](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/mackyle/4c33e4802a8269b3f200f2c00352ce6a/raw/815de4ef4142e13ac0b5c7b55112afdf13391eee/git-log-times.gif "git log-times --graph --date-order --decorate --no-merges -n 5 v2.5.3")

To have all this, Kyle proposed `git-log-times` script for `contrib/`.

Jeff King was surprised to see this as a separate script, and proposed a
[patch series](https://public-inbox.org/git/20160929083315.vwb3aurwbyjwlkjn@sigill.intra.peff.net/)
adding support for features like `--commit-header` option for `git log`,
making it possible to come close to what `git-log-times` provided.

Junio Hamano [reminded](https://public-inbox.org/git/xmqqy42afvy1.fsf@gitster.mtv.corp.google.com/)
that `contrib/` area is not the place for random git-related things.

> Unlike the earlier days of Git, if a custom command that uses Git is
> very userful, it can live its own life and flourish within the much
> larger Git userbase we have these days.

The proposed script was then therefore published as
**[git-log-compact](https://mackyle.github.io/git-log-compact/)** project.


### Support

* [Regression: git no longer works with musl libc's regex impl](https://public-inbox.org/git/20161004150848.GA7949@brightrain.aerifal.cx/) (*written by Jakub Narębski*)

Rich Felker complained that compiling Git with [musl libc](https://www.musl-libc.org/)
no longer works out of the box (that is, without setting the `NO_REGEX`
build configuration variable) after commit [2f895225](https://github.com/git/git/commit/2f8952250a84313b74f96abb7b035874854cf202).
The proposed workaround unfortunately didn't work on Windows, as pointed
out by Jeff King and Johannes Schindelin.

There was a bit of derail about which are main Git platforms, and whether
Git code should be able to rely on POSIX features.  Jakub Narębski reminded
that [CodingGuidelines](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/CodingGuidelines#L4)
specifically state that:

> - Most importantly, we never say "It's in POSIX; we'll happily
>   ignore your needs should your system not conform to it."
>   We live in the real world.
>
> - However, we often say "Let's stay away from that construct,
>   it's not even in POSIX".
>
> - In spite of the above two rules, we sometimes say "Although
>   this is not in POSIX, it (is so convenient | makes the code
>   much more readable | has other good characteristics) and
>   practically all the platforms we care about support it, so
>   let's use it".

The commit in question, making Git require to use regexp engine with
`REG_STARTEND` support, while providing fallback implementation
(turned on with `NO_REGEX`), matches 3rd point in the list above.  This
extension to `regexec()`, introduced by the NetBSD project, is present
in all major regex implementation... though not in musl.

There was yet another proposed fix for the problem, namely adding
padding so that end of mmap-ed file doesn't fall on the page boundary,
if regex implementation doesn't support `REG_STARTEND`.  One one hand,
the workaround relied on undocumented (but sane) assumptions about
operating system behavior, on the other hand it was faster than the
workaround in original patch, that is copying contents to NUL-terminated
buffer.  Nevertheless, any workaround would mean additional code that
needs to be maintained, and it was not accepted.

Also, it turned out that `configure` script detects if regex engine
support `REG_STARTEND` and sets `NO_REGEX` if necessary, it was just
badly described.  It was [since corrected](https://github.com/git/git/commit/842a516cb02a53cf0291ff67ed6f8517966345c0).

Though Git doesn't yet set `NO_REGEX` automatically based on information
from `uname`.

* [Why are there multiple ways to get the manual in Git?](https://public-inbox.org/git/CAM_5GX48gDAZSvAWnxO5n8uhYf8vmfAJ88_31_ewsQxyPfF7iA@mail.gmail.com/)

Andrew Johnson asked on the mailing list:

> While reading Pro Git 2nd Ed. I came across these three methods:
>
> $ git help &lt;verb&gt;<br>
> $ git &lt;verb&gt; --help<br>
> $ man git-&lt;verb&gt;<br>
>
> I tested all three to confirm they were equivalent.
>
> What was the motivation behind the complication, if any? I presume
> most developers would not provide multiple commands that do the same
> thing for absolutely no reason, so I led myself to ask this question.

Fredrik Gustafsson was the first to answer. He first said that the
three commands are not actually equivalent on Windows as:

> $ man git-&lt;verb&gt;
>
> does not work and
>
> $ git help &lt;verb&gt;
>
> opens a webbrowser instead of a man page.

Philip Oakley then answered that the three different methods were
added at different times for different reasons. The man methods was
first added because "historically git was a set of shell scripts named
git-*, so each stood alone".

The `--help` was the result from "the modern `git <cmd>` approach, with
every command normally having `-h` and `--help` options for short form
usage and long form man pages". Meanwhile "a `git help <cmd>` command
was created" which "allowed selection of display type, so that on
Unix/Linux man was the norm, while an `--html` (or `--web`) option is
available for those who like the pretty browser view".

Your own Christian Couder chimed in saying that `git help` makes it
possible to teach people one command that will do something sensible
on every system, and that it also "provides more configurability and
more features like its -a and -g options".

Jakub Narębski added that there are also help pages that are about
"concepts (gitcli, gitrevisions, githooks, gitrepository-layout,
gitglossary), or about files (gitignore, gitattributes, to some extent
githooks)" and they are "only accessible with `git help <concept>` or,
on OS with installed 'man', also `man <gitconcept>`".

Philip replied to the above saying that "`git revisions --help` does
work", but Junio Hamano clarified things by saying that this was a bug
that had been recently fixed.

It would indeed seem wrong to have `git <concept> --help` working, as
concepts are not the same things as commands.

Anyway this shows that it is not so simple to design a good help
system, especially one that is both full featured on different
platforms and looking simple to users.


## Developer Spotlight: Dennis Kaarsemaker

* Who are you and what do you do?

I'm Dennis Kaarsemaker, I do scalability and security things for
Booking.com, part of which includes hacking on our git infrastructure
together with Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason. I also maintain
perl5.git.perl.org and do a lot of user support.

* What would you name your most important contribution to Git?

Spending a lot of time in #git and #github on freenode solving people's
git problems. Occasionally this leads to bug reports or even patches,
but mostly I'm trying to create make users understand git and make them
smile.

* What are you doing on the Git project these days, and why?

Besides user support, I do read the mailing-list and try to review
patches or pick up smaller bugs as time permits. Time however is scarce
with a fearless 14 month old girl crawling around the house trying to
get into trouble :)

* If you could get a team of expert developers to work full time on
  something in Git for a full year, what would it be?

If I had a team of developers, their core focus would be scalability
for very big repositories. Things like a protocol that is efficient
with hundreds of thousands of refs and can be load-balanced properly, or
more efficient storage for refs, external files and other data. Or a
peer to peer continuous sync protocol for the object store.

* If you could remove something from Git without worrying about
  backwards compatibility, what would it be?

Oh, if only I could remove submodules. They're almost universally used
for the wrong reason, are easy to get confused about and use wrong, and
they complicate many parts of git.

* What is your favorite Git-related tool/library, outside of Git itself?

Definitely GitHub. I appreciate that Git is made for distributed
version control, and regularly use it in that way; but the social
benefits of having a single place to discover, maintain and collaborate
on projects that GitHub offers really helps in getting the most out of
my open source experience. I even made a command line API client for
Github, GitLab and BitBucket :)
