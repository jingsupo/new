## Git Rev News: Edition 21 (November 16th, 2016)

Welcome to the 21st edition of [Git Rev News](https://git.github.io/rev_news/rev_news/),
a digest of all things Git. For our goals, the archives, the way we work, and how to contribute or to
subscribe, see [the Git Rev News page](https://git.github.io/rev_news/rev_news/) on [git.github.io](http://git.github.io).

This edition covers what happened during the month of October 2016.

## Discussions

### General

* [Git related discussions at the Google Summer of Code Mentor Summit](https://sites.google.com/site/2016gsocmentorsummit/home)

There were a number of Git related discussions at the Google Summer of
Code (GSoC) Mentor Summit that took place in Google offices in
Sunnyvale California from October 29th to October 30th.

298 mentors from 149 organizations attended the event. There were some
talks that had been planned by the GSoC team at Google to talk mostly
about the past GSoC and the future one. But most of the event was
organized in an "unconference" style by the mentors who were there.

The first "unconference" style Git related talk was led by
[Brendan Forster](https://github.com/shiftkey) and
[Parker Moore](https://github.com/parkr) from GitHub.
Their goal was to get input from mentors about what they like and
don't like about GitHub.

Most of the GitHub features discussed were related to GitHub pages and
to discussion threads in issues and pull requests. Parker, who is also
the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) maintainer, often replied to
requests with "you'll be happy... soon". So it looked like GitHub
has been working on a number of new features in those areas and has
been planning to release some of them soon, though Parker said they
couldn't promise anything concrete.

Some people specifically asked if it would be possible to have a
better integration between email and discussion threads in issues and
pull requests. Discussions about this subject often happen on the Git
mailing list, for example there was a long one last August under the
title ["Working with public-inbox.org"](http://public-inbox.org/git/CAGZ79kasebzJb=b2n=JQiVMrSfJKaVfZaaoaVJFkXWuqKjfYKw@mail.gmail.com/).
But it looks like it is complex and sensitive subject and it is not
likely that good solutions will appear soon.

Ironically the next unconference talk, led by Martin Braun from
[GNU Radio](http://gnuradio.org/) in the same room, called
"The Closed-Source Proliferation", was about the fact that many open
source projects now use and depend on closed source tools like GitHub
and Slack.

A number of mentors said that they are using GitHub because of the
network effect and also because they don't want to spend time, and
maybe money, managing their own servers and a number of different
tools on them.

Some people replied that it should be possible to have projects hosted
by university related organizations like
[OSU Open Source Lab](http://osuosl.org/) using open source tools. It
also appears that Canadian universities are now required to host their
software on servers located in Canada, which excludes GitHub, so some
universities there have started to setup solutions.

People mentioned that [GitLab-CE](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/),
the GitLab Community Edition, was a good solution for them, but others
were not happy that there is [GitLab-EE](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/),
the GitLab Enterprise Edition, which is not open source.

The last Git related talk called "Git/Gerrit" had been planned by the
Google team and was given by Shawn Pearce. Shawn used to work on Git a
lot, and has created JGit, EGit and
[Gerrit](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/). He is now leading a
large team at Google working on version control related things. Four
members of his team have been contributing to Git. Stefan Beller and
Jonathan Nieder have been contributing for a long time, while Brandon
Williams and Jonathan Tan started contributing more recently.

In his talk, Shawn described how Git has been developing a big test
suite since it's beginning in 2005 and that it's "worth its weight
when you have 1438 contributors". It has helped Junio set a
"consistent bar about quality" and has been a "huge success" that has
"prevented too many regressions to be counted".

On the contrary Shawn said that he started Gerrit in 2008, but they
didn't really test its REST API until 2013, and didn't do any UI tests
until 2016, "shame on me".

For a long time Gerrit tests relied on "monkeys testing everything"
and there were a lot of regressions. It was hard to get confidence on
releases.

There are 284 contributors, and now 1847 junit tests and 524 polymer
tests. The tests give confidence in the quality of the new
releases. They are run on every commit which is easy to do with Gerrit
as it can be linked with tools like Travis CI, Circle CI or Jenkins
and the result of the tests can be displayed in the interface along
with the review of each commit.

He said though that automation has its limits as it difficult to test
all configurations.

### Support

* [Expanding Includes in .gitignore](https://public-inbox.org/git/80919456-7563-2c16-ba23-ce4fcc2777de@pelly.co/)

Aaron Pelly asked for a new feature on the mailing list:

> I want git to be able to include, in its gitignore files, sub-files of
> ignores or have it understand a directory of ignore files. Or both.

He wanted to be able to pull from https://github.com/github/gitignore
and "include relevant bits project by project and/or system wide",
without having to "update many projects manually if that, or any other,
repo changes".

And after discussing possible implementations, he asked:

> I would like to know the desirability/practicality/stupidity of such a
> feature as I believe it is within my skillset to implement it.

Stefan Beller suggested to (sym)link .git/info/exclude to an up to
date version of the gitignore repo as a hack. But Aaron said he would
still need to copy stuff from one file to another by hand as there
would be sections that are project, language, editor, machine,
whatever, specific.

Then Alexei Lozovsky, Jacob Keller, Jeff King, Duy Nguyen and Aaron
discussed possible implementations. One possibility was to add
"include" directives in .gitignore files, but that was considered
complex and dangerous.

The other possibility, favored by the reviewers, was to add either
".gitignore.d" or ".git/info/exclude.d" directories that would contain
many files. The content of those files would be concatenated by Git to
get the actual information about what should be ignored.

Jacob Keller, alias Jake, said that the reading of files in such a
directory should "exclude reading .git or other hidden files in some
documented manor so as to avoid problems when linking to a git
directory for its contents".

Jeff King, alias Peff, said that the ".git/info/exclude.d" approach
could be implement without any changes by doing:

```
  path=.git/info/exclude
  cat $path.d/* >$path
```

and if we actually implement something like that, then

```
  cd .git/info
  git clone /my/exclude/repo exclude ;# or exclude.d
```

should work.

Duy replied that there could be complications with negative patterns
though.

Junio Hamano wrote that he does "not see the point of making in-tree
.gitignore to a forest of .gitignore.d/ at all, compatibility
complications is not worth even thinking about". But it looks like the
possibility of having a ".git/info/exclude.d" directory is still open.


## Developer Spotlight: Jacob Keller, alias Jake

* Who are you and what do you do?

My name is Jake, I'm an avid contributor to various open source
projects. I currently work for Intel doing Linux network programming
for their 10GbE/40GbE Ethernet networking driver. I have contributed
to Git to help resolve specific issues I've had in the past, and
continue to contribute as I like to give back to the communities that
I depend on as a software developer.

* What would you name your most important contribution to Git?

I would say my most important contribution was modifying the refspec
globs for fetching to allow globbing past / (slash) boundaries.
However, the largest contribution is probably the `diff
--submodule=inline-diff` format for displaying the full diff between a
submodule change.

* What are you doing on the Git project these days, and why?

Currently I have mostly spent time trying to find areas where my
review could be helpful. There are a few projects I wouldn't mind
working on, but as my employer has not hired me directly to work on
Git, that limits the amount of time that I spend during work hours.
I'm certainly open to new opportunities to contribute in the future.

* If you could get a team of expert developers to work full time on
  something in Git for a full year, what would it be?

Hmm. This is a tough question. I think the biggest things I would work
towards is implementing something like git-series as a core part of
git, at the very least providing the tools needed to make storing the
meta-history easier. For example, using git series today is pretty
good, but I often mess up and use regular git commands to look at
branches or status, and it can tend to make the experience very
brittle. Additionally there is the effort to implement
[gitrefs](https://public-inbox.org/git/xmqqa8dfdt6y.fsf@gitster.mtv.corp.google.com/)
for storing reachability information about objects. Having this sort
of tool built into git would allow more commands and areas to
recognize them easily, making the entire experience much smoother.

* If you could remove something from Git without worrying about
  backwards compatibility, what would it be?

Honestly? I would re-write much of the interface to be more
consistent, removing aspects which aren't consistent with some of our
more modern design. A good example, was a colleague of mine who is not
very fluent in git recently tried to checkout a new branch from our
main remote, and ended up doing something like:

```
$ git branch -a
# copy the "remotes/origin/branch"
$ git checkout <copied text>
```

which unfortunately didn't actually end up doing what she had
intended. She then accidentally included commits into a release tag
without realizing they weren't on that particular branch. These sort
of pain points exist in a lot of places. Most of the time, they exist
because the tool provides additional express ability and power at some
expense of cost. It may also be simply a documentation issue.

However, there are many warts on the user interface that I would love
to be able to deprecate and remove as they cause issues for co-workers
who are new to Git. I love using Git, and I think the extra tools that
we have created are very beneficial, but I have many coworkers who
haven't gotten over that initial road block.

* What is your favorite Git-related tool/library, outside of Git itself?

I think right now it is git-series. I have also extensively used
Stacked Git in the past. Both of these tools help to manage a patch
series, and this is something that I think core git is currently
lacking in.

* What are your favorite Git features?

Definitely interactive addition, and the ability to rebase local
history. Ever since I realized that I could re-write history, I have
changed my development model to develop and commit fast, then re-write
to look good later. Additionally, I aim to make my work easily
bisectable, since I have used git-bisect "run" to varying degrees of
success. The number of times that I've tried to do some history
archeology and ended up on an "Import from CVS" commit that meant
nothing to my issue, has led me to heavily make use of tools to make
my history as presentable as possible.

* What is your preferred Git development model?

I think pull-requests, with avid local rebasing and squashing of
commits. Followed shortly by the use of a tool like Gerrit or a
mailing list for review.

* How did you get involved in the Git project?

So, at my job, we used to use CVS to store our project history. We
have a lot of tooling around this history, including build servers. We
eventually migrated to Git, but one of the funny things that we did
carried over. When you have to compare to "versions" in  CVS, the only
reasonable way to do so is to tag, since tags are the only thing
combining multiple files together.

So, the people who migrated tools for Git decided that Git builds
would create the same style of tags of the form
"`tag_<YYMMDD>_<HHMMSS>`", which are these ridiculous tags that we need
for CVS comparing of different build versions.

I tried to make them change the tool, but they refused. I found out
that I could exclude certain refs when fetching, by not fetching tags
and instead fetching specific "refs/tags/\*". However, this would still
fetch all these tags I didn't care about. So I modified Git to allow
using * with less than a full section, so I could say fetch
"refs/tags/driver-\*" which would fetch human readable tags that were
meaningful without fetching hundreds of tags created by nightly
builds.
